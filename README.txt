Title: Assignment 2  
 
===========================================================================

TESTED ON:
 
macOS (with Xcode and g++ installed)
 
 
===========================================================================
FILES INCLUDED:

part1 Folder: The user will need be shown the knapsack 0/1 output followed by 
              the fractional knapsack and the combo knapsack for comparison  
    
part2 Folder: The file must be input like the test.txt file given

part3 Folder: Takes the mistyped word in the first position in the string array called strs and the suggested words in the rest of the array.
              Loops through and finds the number of differences between each suggested word and the mistyped word while keeping track of the lowest differences.
              Prints out each word and the number of differences.
              Then prints out the suggested word/words with the lowest number of differences.


part4 Folder: compile as depicted in the images for the turned in doc
 
 

===========================================================================
COMPILE PROGRAM:
 
To compile this part one navigate inside the part1 folder and the easiest 
compilation uses the command format:

	g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp

This command will create an executable in the same directory called "a.out" 
(the default executable target name when one is not specified). 

To compile this part two open the part2 folder and the easiest compilation 
uses the command format:

	g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp

This command will create an executable in the same directory called "a.out" 
(the default executable target name when one is not specified). 
 
===========================================================================
EXECUTE PROGRAM:
 
After you have successfully compiled the program, producing the default 
executable output, the program may be executed using the command format:

	./a.out

This command will run the resulting executable in the same directory.
The configuration file will then be requested from the user ex.config1.txt
this file needs to be in the same directory as the rest of the files. The
population.txt relevant to that configuration file also needs to be in the 
same directory.
