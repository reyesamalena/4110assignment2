In a place in La Mancha, whose name I don't want to remember, there hasn't been a long time living a
Hidalgo de los de lance in shipyard, old adarga, skinny rocín and galgo corridor. A pot of something more cow
That ram, splashed the most nights, duels and breaks on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, some
Palomino additive on Sundays, consumed the three parts of his farm. The rest of it concluded
sayo de velarte, hairy tights for the holidays with their slippers of the same, on weekdays
He honored himself with his finest vellori. He had a housekeeper in his house who was in his forties, and one
niece who did not reach twenty, and a boy of field and square, so saddled the rock as he took the
pruning shear. The age of our gentleman with fifty years old was fierce, it was of a hard, dry complexion of
meat, faceless; Great early riser and friend of the hunt. They mean he had the nickname of
Quijada or Quesada (that in this there is some difference in the authors that in this case write), although by
plausible conjectures are understood as being called Quijana; but this matters little to our story;
it is enough that in the narrative he does not leave a point of truth.
It is, therefore, to know, that this above mentioned gentleman, the times he was idle (which were the most of the year) were
He read cavalry books with such fondness and taste that he almost forgot the exercise of the
hunting, and even the administration of his farm; and he got so much his curiosity and folly in this, that he sold
many hanegas of sowing land, to buy books of chivalry in which to read; and so he led his
house as many as there could be of them; and of all none seemed as good as those who composed the
famous Feliciano de Silva: because the clarity of his prose, and those intricate reasons of his, seemed to him
pearl; and more when he came to read those requirements and challenge letters, where in many places
was written, the reason for the unreason with which my reason is, so weakens my reason that
with reason I complain of your fermosura , and also when he read: the high heavens that of your
divinity divinely with the stars are fortified, and make you deserve the merit that
your greatness deserves . With these and such reasons the poor gentleman lost his mind, and
unveiled by understanding them, and unraveling their meaning, not to take it out, nor to understand it
Aristotle, if he were resurrected for just that. He was not very well with the wounds that Don Belianis gave and
he received, because he imagined that no matter how great teachers had healed him, he would not stop having the
face and whole body full of scars and signs; but with all praise in its author that end his
book with the promise of that endless adventure, and many times he wanted to take the pen, and
put an end to the letter as promised there; and without a doubt he would do it, and still go out with it, if others
Greater and continuous thoughts will not hinder you.
He had many times competition with the priest of his place (who was a learned man graduated in Sigüenza),
on which one had been a better gentleman, Palmerín de Inglaterra or Amadís de Gaula; but Master Nicholas,
barber of the same town, said that none came to the knight of Febo, and that if anyone could
compare, it was Don Galaor, brother of Amadis de Gaula, because he had a very comfortable condition for
everything; that he was not a melindrous gentleman, nor as crying as his brother, and that in the matter of bravery he was not going
behind.
In resolution, he became so involved in his reading that he spent his nights reading from clear to clear, and
the days of murky in murky, and thus, from little sleep and much reading, his brain dried up, so that
He came to lose his mind. Fill him with the fantasy of everything he read in books, as well as enchantments,
as of pendencies, battles, challenges, wounds, requiebros, loves, storms and impossible nonsense, and
settled in the imagination in such a way that all the machine of those dreamed was true
inventions he read, that for him there was no more true story in the world.
He said that Cid Ruy Díaz had been a very good gentleman; but that had nothing to do with the knight of
the fiery sword, which in just one setback had split between two fierce and huge giants.
He was better with Bernardo del Carpio, because in Roncesvalle he had died to Roldán the enchanted one,
using the Hercules industry, when he drowned Anteo, the son of the Earth, in his arms. He said
much good of the giant Morgante, because with being of that gigantic generation, that all are
arrogant and decompressed, he was only affable and well raised; but above all he was fine with Reinaldos of
Montalbán, and more when he saw him leave his castle and steal how many he came across, and when in Allende he stole
that idol of Muhammad, which was all gold, according to his story. He would give, to give a hand of kicks to the
traitor of Galalon, the mistress he had and even his niece of addition.
In fact, already finished his trial, he came to give in the strangest thought that ever gave mad in the
world, and it was that it seemed convenient and necessary, so for the increase of his honor, as for the service
from his republic, become a walking knight, and go around the world with his weapons and horse to look for the
adventures, and exercise in everything he had read, that walking knights were exercising,
undoing all kinds of grievance, and putting on occasions and dangers, where finishing them, charging
Eternal name and fame.
Imagine the poor man already crowned by the value of his arm at least of Trapison's empire: and so
With these pleasant thoughts, taken from the strange taste he felt in them, he was quick to put
indeed what I wanted. And the first thing he did was clean some weapons, which had been his
great-grandfathers, who, taken of urine and full of mold, had long centuries that were laid and forgotten
in a corner. He cleaned and seasoned them as best he could; but he saw that they had a great lack, and it was that no
he had lace headpiece, but simple morrion; but this supplied its industry, because of cardboard made a
half-head mode, which fitted with the morrion, made an appearance of whole head. It is true that
to test if he was strong, and could be at the risk of a knife, he drew his sword, and struck him twice, and
with the first and at one point he undid what he had done in a week: and he didn't stop looking bad
ease with which he had broken it, and to make sure of this danger, he did it again,
by putting iron bars inside him in such a way that he was satisfied with his strength; and,
not wanting to make a new experience of her, the deputy and considered fine lace. He went to see
his nag, and although it had more rooms than a real and more blemishes than the horse Gonela, which tantum
pellis, et ossa fuit , it seemed that neither Alexander 's Bucephalus or the Babieca of the Cid matched with him.
Four days passed to imagine what name he could: because, as he said to himself, it was not
reason that knight horse so famous, and so good he himself, was without a known name; and so
he tried to accommodate him, so that he would declare who he had been, before he was a walking knight,
and what it was then: well he was very right, that by moving his lord state, he also moved
name; and charged him famous and roaring, as it suited the new order and the new exercise that already
professed: and so after many names that formed, deleted and removed, added, undid and did again in
his memory and imagination, he finally came to call ROCINANTE, his name seems loud, loud and
meaningful of what it had been when it was rocín, before what it was now, that it was before and first of
All the rocines in the world. Put his horse's name and so to his liking, he wanted to put himself, and in
this thought lasted another eight days, and after that it came to be called DON QUIJOTE, where is it from
said, the authors of this true story took a chance, which should undoubtedly be called Quijada, and
No Quesada as others meant. But remembering that the brave Amadis, not only had
content to be called Amadis to dry, but added the name of his kingdom and homeland, to make it
famous, and his name was Amadis de Gaula, so he wanted, as a good gentleman, to add his name to his,
and be called DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA, with which in his opinion he declared his lineage and homeland very alive,
and honored her with taking the nickname della.
Clean, then, his weapons, made of the headless morrion, named his rocín, and confirming himself
himself, it was implied that he was not missing anything else, but to look for a lady to fall in love with, because
the walking knight without love, was a tree without leaves and without fruit, and body without soul. He told himself: if I by
bad of my sins, for my good luck, I find some giant out there, like
Ordinarily it happens to the walking knights, and I knock him out of an encounter, or give birth to him by half of the
body, or finally, I beat him and surrender him, won't it be good to have someone to send to him, and that he enters and
kneel before my sweet lady, and say in a humble and surrendered voice: I ma'am, I'm the giant
Caraculiambro, lord of the Malindranian island, who was defeated in a never-before-due battle
praised gentleman D. Quijote de la Mancha, who commanded me to present myself at your mercy,
so that your greatness disposes of me in its spirit? Oh, how our good gentleman loosed,
when he had made this speech, and more when he found who to name his lady! And it was, to what I know
he thinks that in a place near his there was a wench of good looks, of whom he
time walked in love, although it is understood, she never knew or tasted it. Call
Aldonza Lorenzo, it already seemed good to give her the title of lady of her thoughts; and looking for him
name that did not give much of his, and that threw and headed to the princess and great lady, came to
call her DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO, because she was a native of Toboso, a musician's name and
Pilgrim and meaningful, like everyone else that he and his things had put.
Once these precautions were made, he didn't want to wait any longer to put his thoughts into effect, squeezing to it the lack that he thought his delay was making in the world, according to the grievances that I planned to undo, one-eyed people to right, unreasonable things to amend, and abuses to improve, and debts that satisfy; and so, without giving any person his intention, and without anyone seeing him, one morning, before the day (which was one of the hot of the month of July), he armed himself with all his weapons, climbed on Rocinante, put on his poorly composed head, embracing his grasp, took his spear, and through the false door of a corral, went out to the field with great content and
